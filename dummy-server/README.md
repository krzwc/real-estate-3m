## Installation
A new `scrap3m.json` file may be generated first as described here: [https://github.com/krzykaczu/real-estate-3m-webscraper](https://github.com/krzykaczu/real-estate-3m-webscraper)<br>
`scrap3m.json` file available in the package may also be used, but some external links may not be valid anymore (please mind the last update of the scrap3m.json file).

A new instance of the `scrap3m.json` file should replace the old one in the main folder and then:
```
npm run localstart
```
The server should be running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
